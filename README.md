A sample .NET 10 project demonstrating how to generate a complex, multi-sheet Excel sales report using the powerful **ClosedXML** library. This project is designed to showcase a common backend task: automating business intelligence reports directly from application data, with **zero dependency on Microsoft Office**.

## ✨ Features

Based on the uploaded file analysis, the generated report is a single `.xlsx` file containing 4 distinct worksheets:

* **📊 SUMMARY:** A high-level dashboard with KPIs (Total Revenue, Average Ticket) and a "Top 5 Selling Products" list.
* **📋 Detailed:** A raw data dump of all individual sales transactions.
* **📦 By Category:** Aggregated sales data grouped by product category.
* **👤 By Seller:** Performance metrics (Total Sales, Revenue) broken down by seller.

### ClosedXML Features Demonstrated

* Creating multiple worksheets (tabs).
* Applying rich cell styling (background colors, bold fonts, alignment).
* Merging cells (`Merge()`) for titles.
* Setting data number formats (Currency, Dates, Numbers).
* Auto-adjusting column widths (`AdjustToContents()`).
* Creating formatted tables.
